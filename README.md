# Image To Text
This repository helps you view images as text. Written in Python.

You are free to do whatever you want with this code.

The main functions are in image_to_text.py file.

To play a video in text form start by exporting the frames of your video using vid_to_frame.py file.
Then you can play the video using play_frames.py file.
After running play_frames.py python will wait for you to press space. Then output.txt will be updated in real time and you can watch the playing video by opening output.txt. I recommend using Visual Studio Code.

If you don't want to use bad_apple.mp4 as your video, make sure you change the settings in the first few lines in vid_to_frame.py and play_frames.py files.

If you wanna practice coding python, try making your own version of this and using your camera as image input.
